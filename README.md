A short program to calculate various aspects of a circle given two specific points!

Point are entered via x values first, then y values.
This means you must enter data for x1, then x2, then y1, then y2 to recieve expected results.

I was unsure if I needed to round answers to 3 decimal points, but unfortunately was within the 24 hour window by the time I noticed that was in the expected output files.

This was honestly a really fun coding puzzle, had me thinking about it at work all day today!
